# OntoPopulation4Intent
This repository includes the data used for evaluations for the paper "Ontology Population Reusing Resources for Dialogue Intent Detection: Generic and Multilingual Approach", to be presented at RANLP 2021.

# Paper abstract
This work presents a generic semi-automatic strategy to populate the domain ontology of an ontology-driven task-oriented dialogue system, with the aim of performing successful intent detection in the dialogue process, reusing already existing multilingual resources. This semi-automatic approach allows ontology engineers to exploit available resources so as to associate the potential situations in the use case to FrameNet frames and obtain the relevant lexical units associated to them in the target language, following lexical and semantic criteria, without linguistic expert knowledge. This strategy has been validated and evaluated in two use cases, from industrial scenarios, for interaction in Spanish with a guide robot and with a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). In both cases, this method has allowed the ontology engineer to instantiate the domain ontology with the intent-relevant information with quality data in a simple and low-resource-consuming manner.

# Files
The results are provided through a .xlsx file and a .txt file.
The .txt file has been generated from the output in eval.py.

# TODO
Make eval.py cleaner ;)
